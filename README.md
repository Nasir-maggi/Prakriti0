Determining an individual's Prakriti, a fundamental concept in Ayurveda has long been a challenging and intricate process. Traditional Prakriti assessment methods required extensive consultations with Ayurvedic practitioners, making it arduous and time-consuming. **Prikriti Determine** features a Machine learning-based chatbot capable of efficiently determining a user's Prakriti type. The chatbot assesses various facets of their body and mind by engaging users in a friendly conversation and asking a series of well-crafted questions. This approach allows for a more consistent and objective Prakriti analysis. Based on the Prakriti, the chatbot gives diet recommendations.
